Stars and Bars Theorem : 
	if [n,k>=0], 
the number of K-tuples of non-negative integers 
whose sum is N =>(N+K−1)C(N) =>(N+K−1)C(K−1).
if (n>0 && k >0) : (N−1)C(K−1).

Theorem: 
	If we have K distinguishable containers and
	 N indistinguishable balls, 
	 then we can distribute them in (N+K−1)C(N) ways.
Theorem: 
	if (n>0 && k >0) , 
	the number of K-tuples of positive integers 
	whose sum is N  => (N−1)C(K−1).
Theorem:
	if (n>0 && k >0) , 
	the number of K-tuples of non-negative integers 
	whose sum <= N => (N+K)C(K).

	Random Tree Generation, 
	Cayley’s Formula,
	Building Tree from Degree Count

number of spanning trees with N node is N^(N−2).
